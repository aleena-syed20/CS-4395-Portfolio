### What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing is the ability for a computer to understand written or spoken human language.

### Relationship Between NLP and AI

NLP is a branch of AI, as it allows for computers to understand and interpret human language. AI, which are machines that can simulate human intelligence, is the umbrella which NLP falls under.

### Comparing natural language understanding and generation

Natural language understanding analyzes text to determine its meaning, whereas natural language generation allows computers to write text. 

### Examples of NLP applications

1. Email Spam Filters 
2. Alexa, Siri
3. Google translate

### 3 Main Approaches to NLP

Rule-based NLP is used to approach text processing. The rules are written manually in a familiar format, such as an email. It does not deal with variety well due to following a particular set of rules.

Machine learning-based NLP uses algorithms to analyze patterns in text. The text will need to be cleaned using data preparation methods, which will then be used as the dataset for a model for training. Predictions will be then made based on these models.

Deep learning-based NLP uses neural networks that take in raw text without previously defined features. Features will be learned by the networks independently. 

### Personal Interest in NLP

I'm interested in NLP when it relates to sentiment analysis. I worked on a project last semester in Intro to Machine Learning that dealt with sentiment analysis, and it was an engaging topic that I learned a lot from. I'd like to continue working on projects in the NLP space, and possibly expand my previous project with new information from this class.
